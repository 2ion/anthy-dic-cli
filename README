The development of this program is on hold, as I have stopped using
Anthy in favour of mozc (http://code.google.com/p/mozc) which seems to
come with a better dictionary, better kanji and inflection recognition,
an engine-driven handwriting recognition tool and a comfortable
dictionary editor. All these features make a program like this
superfluous.

Sorry, Anthy, you victim of Software Darwinism.
